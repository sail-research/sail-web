- title: "Efficiently Assemble Normalization Layers and Regularization for Federated Domain Generalization"
  image: paper-cvpr24.png
  description: We introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG, namely gPerXAN, which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular, we carefully design Personalized Xplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features.
