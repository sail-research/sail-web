## Postdoctoral Fellowship in Machine Learning, Information Security, and Trustworthy AI (The positions are currently closed!)

<!-- We are seeking a highly motivated and skilled postdoctoral fellow with experience in machine learning, information security, and trustworthy AI. The project focuses on designing a trustworthy federated learning (FL) framework for the healthcare system with theoretical guarantees for its privacy, robustness, and agent-level data valuation and explainability, aiming to make the healthcare systems more efficient and trustworthy. The successful candidate will develop novel approaches for federated learning in medical systems. The candidate will be embedded in a highly international research group offering wide expertise in machine learning on medical dataset. Also, we provide the candidate with direct access to computing facilities optimized for machine/deep learning. -->

The position is for two years and comes with a competitive salary and benefits package. For more information and to apply, please visit [Opening Postdoc](https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn/?careers=postdoctoral-fellowship-in-machine-learning-information-security-and-trustworthy-ai).

## Ph.D in Computer Science (Several Positions Available)
We are inviting applications for a Ph.D. position in Computer Science at VinUniversity. The successful candidate will join our dynamic research team and work on cutting-edge projects in Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. 
This Ph.D. position offers a unique opportunity for candidates to pursue their research interests, collaborate with experienced researchers, and contribute to advancing knowledge in the field.

The research project will focus on the following topics:
- Trustworthy, Robust, and Explainable Federated Learning
- AI Security with Generative Models and Large Language Models

For more information, please visit [VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center's website](https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn/project/privacy-preserving-robust-and-explainable-federated-learning-framework-for-healthcare-system/).

Interested candidates should submit the following application materials to Prof. Kok-Seng Wong at `wong.ks@vinuni.edu.vn` and Prof. Khoa Doan `khoa.dd@vinuni.edu.vn` with the subject line "**Application for Ph.D. position**":
- Updated CV/Resume
- Statement of Purpose outlining research interests and goals
- Transcripts of undergraduate and/or Master's coursework
- Contact information for at least two academic or professional references


## Full-time Research Assistant (Several Positions Available)

We are also seeking several full-time research assistants to work with a team of researchers in our lab. The topics for the research assistant positions are:

- Trustworthy, Robust, and Explainable Federated Learning
- Federated Recommender Systems
- Federated Adversarial Training
- Large Language Models and AI Security

<!-- The research assistants will support the development and implementation of federated learning models and algorithms. This may include data collection and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and technical report writing. The research assistants will also be responsible for staying up-to-date with the latest machine learning developments and contributing to the team's research efforts. -->

<!-- The ideal candidates will have a strong background in computer science, mathematics, or a related field, with experience in machine learning and programming. A Bachelor's or Master's degree is required. These are full-time positions with competitive salary and benefits packages.  -->

<!-- For more information and to apply, please send your CV and a cover letter to `wong.ks@vinuni.edu.vn` with the subject line "Research Assistant Position". -->

Interested applicants should send a CV to Prof. Kok-Seng Wong (`wong.ks@vinuni.edu.vn`) and Prof. Khoa Doan (`khoa.dd@vinuni.edu.vn`) with the subject line "**Application for RA position**". The application should include a CV, a cover letter, and the names and contact information of at least one reference. The positions are open until filled.


<!--
**We are currently open for PhD and postdoc applications related to our ERC CoG grant. The positions are mostly related to the Electron Pair Microscopy projects.**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries. -->

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**


### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation). -->
