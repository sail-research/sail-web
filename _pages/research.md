# Research
At the Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab, our dedication lies in advancing the fields of Federated Learning and NLP Robustness.

In the field of Federated Learning, we investigate various aspects such as privacy concerns, novel algorithms, fairness considerations, and more. Our goal is to address the challenges associated with federated learning, including backdoor attacks, federated unlearning, personalized federated learning, and fairness. By conducting research in these areas, we strive to advance the state-of-the-art and promote the adoption of secure and privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. Join our research lab and be part of our vibrant community focused on cutting-edge research in Machine Learning, Federated Learning, Information Security, and Trustworthy AI.

In NLP Robustness, we focus on ensuring the Robustness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Our research group explores topics such as adversarial attacks, defense mechanisms, model interpretability, and more. Through in-depth discussions and research, we aim to deepen our understanding of NLP robustness and contribute to the development of robust NLP systems.
