<!-- We are a dynamic research group at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl). Our aim is to explore and understand [quantum materials](http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.nl/2013/05/what-is-quantum-matter.html), including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. -->

Our research group is situated within [VinUniversity's College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/). We specialize in the field of trustworthy AI, with a core focus on simplifying the development and deployment of machine learning models while ensuring their robustness. Our research encompasses low-complexity generative approaches, strengthening algorithmic robustness, and tackling critical challenges in machine learning and federated learning to enhance security, privacy, efficiency, and fairness.

Our research group specializes in trustworthy AI. We focus on simplifying ML model development and deployment while ensuring robustness. Our work includes low-complexity generative approaches, algorithmic robustness, and addressing key challenges in ML and federated learning for enhanced security, privacy, efficiency, and fairness. -->

<!-- Our lab specializes in research related to trustworthy and practical AI solutions. We believe that by understanding the limits of existing machine/ federated learning methods and developing novel computational frameworks, we can address the complexities and constraints of real-world scenarios. Our research tackles the key aspects of **simplicity** and **reliability**. We strive to make machine learning/ federated learning models easier to build, deploy, and evolve, while ensuring their performance remains consistent under perturbations and security attack.

Our research primarily revolves around generative-based approaches that exhibit low computational complexity and require minimal human effort. We strive to develop solutions that excel in these areas. Currently, our research activities encompass a wide range of themes, including but not limited to:
- Enhancing **training** and **inference** processes
- Incorporating **realistic assumptions** into ML models
- Ensuring **algorithmic robustness** in challenging environments
- Improving efficiency for deployment in **constrained settings**

At our Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab, we also focus on addressing key challenges in machine learning and federated learning. Our research encompasses robust defense mechanisms against **backdoor attacks**, the **deployment** of federated learning on edge devices, techniques for secure data removal and **personalized federated learning**, and ensuring **fairness** in AI systems. Through our innovative work, we aim to advance trustworthy AI by enhancing security, privacy, efficiency, and fairness in machine learning and federated learning applications. -->

<!-- We strive to make meaningful contributions to the field of ai security, information security, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the security and privacy of individuals and organizations. We work towards finding solutions that apply to smart healthcare and beyond. -->

<!-- Our research group consists of faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and students who are passionate about information security and committed to advancing the state-of-the-art in this field. Our lab is equipped with advanced hardware and software infrastructure to support cutting-edge research activities. -->

<!-- Our research laboratory is dedicated to exploring various aspects of data privacy and security, with a particular focus on data anonymization, data sharing, and data privacy in machine learning. We strive to develop innovative techniques that preserve the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, while allowing for effective data analysis. Additionally, we are actively investigating the security aspects of machine learning and federated learning, specifically concerning different types of attacks such as backdoor attacks and inference attacks. Our goal is to develop robust techniques capable of detecting and mitigating these attacks, thereby safeguarding the security and privacy of federated learning systems. -->

<!-- One of our main research focuses is on developing secure and efficient cryptographic protocols for various applications, including secure data sharing and computation, authentication, and privacy-preserving machine learning. We are also investigating the vulnerability of cryptographic systems to attacks, such as side-channel attacks, and developing countermeasures to enhance their security. -->

<!-- Another area of research that we are actively pursuing is data privacy, including data anonymization, data sharing, and data privacy in machine learning. We are developing novel privacy-preserving techniques that can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data while enabling effective data analysis. -->

<!-- Moreover, we are investigating the security of modern computing systems and networks against various types of attacks, such as backdoor attacks, malware, and phishing. In particular, we are interested in developing techniques that can detect and mitigate backdoor attacks, which can be used to compromise the security and privacy of computer systems and networks. -->

<!-- Currently, we are conducting research on three main topics. The first topic is a Collaborative Framework Design for Distributed Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, which aims to design a framework that can efficiently perform privacy-preserving machine learning tasks in a distributed environment.

The second topic is a Privacy-Preserving, Robust, and Explainable Federated Learning Framework for Healthcare System, which focuses on designing a federated learning framework that can maintain the privacy of sensitive healthcare data while allowing for robust and explainable machine learning models.

The third topic is Collaborative Data Anonymization, which aims to develop techniques for anonymizing data while preserving its utility and enabling collaboration between organizations.

To join our lab, you should have a solid foundation in computer science, including good programming skills, critical thinking, and a good understanding of mathematics. We welcome students who are passionate about information security and privacy and are excited to work on cutting-edge research projects. -->

<!-- To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). -->

<!-- We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl). -->
